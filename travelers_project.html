for Endava during trips was a tricky one. The entire flow had lots of steps that were perceived sometimes as useless bureaucratic requirements. The process had the following points of improvement: </p>

										After I identify the main issues where users were having
while creating expenses reports, I prototyped an initial
solution through raw sketches and a low level prototype
in Marvel app in order to validate how the main flow of the
app could be designed. I conducted some guerrilla testing
(3 users), and ask them to create a trip where all their
expenses would be collected. I gathered results that helped
me to create a more refined version of the prototype. This
vearly early version <a href="https://marvelapp.
com/69i2ecj">could be seen here.</a>
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>
										Through this first App map, and the first visuals,
I could designed another prototype, this time in
Invision. With this prototype I could conduct
another round of user testing, that helped to
validate the concept (if users think this could
help to solve the problem of tracking expenses
more easily), the understandability of the flow
navigation, how users found the main tasks to
do, how the text recognition functionality helped
them to track their invoices, and finally, finding
some points of improvement. This prototype
could be seen in the <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.
com/share/Q8OD9U26R9N#/screens"> following link</a>.

						After validating a first concept I was able to create
the app architecture. Because time was running and
we needed to have a first prototype to test in Beta, I
started doing some visual work as I was working on
the App navigation. This flow could be seen <a href="https://overflow.io/s/FWJ8MT/?node=3aa37f46">in this

						Since this was an internal project, I designed the first version with the branding of
the company in mind. The first version was the android app, done according the material
design standards, and the latter was the iOS version, that I did attending the Apple HCI
guidelines for their mobile devices.
