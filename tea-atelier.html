				<h2 class="name-title">Tea atelier</h2>
				<p class="intro">
					I was asked to redesign the website of a small tea atelier based in Bogot√°, Colombia. This small business is a place where tea and its culture are the main focus along with other activities that promote a quiet life. The owners believe it is possible to take daily life one cup of tea at a time.

										I conducted a SWOT (Strenghts, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis between some of the most representative business in the area. I evaluated how they sell their products and services online and possible features to have in the Tea Atelier website.

								To know more about tea drinkers in the area, I conducted some user research. Some of the respondents were very knowledgeable about tea, while others had just been introduced to this culture. However, gathered insights from different profiles of tea enthusiasts helped me discover some of their concerns about buying tea and what they wanted to know about the tea culture.
